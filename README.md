# JavaScript Operators Practice

### Instructions:
- Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
- Create a new file named `operators.js`.
- Answer the following questions inside `operators.js`.
- Make sure to test your code by running it in the browser console or Node.js environment.
- After completing all tasks, push your answers to your GitHub repository.

### 1. Arithmetic Operators

Write a JavaScript program to perform the following operations. Store the results in variables and log them to the console.

- Add two numbers: `12` and `8`.
- Subtract two numbers: `20` and `5`.
- Multiply two numbers: `6` and `7`.
- Divide two numbers: `24` and `4`.
- Find the remainder of `29` divided by `6`.
  
```js
// Example
let result = 12 + 8;
console.log(result); // Expected output: 20
```

---

### 2. Comparison Operators

Write a program to compare the following pairs of values using comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`). Print the result (`true` or `false`) for each comparison.

- Compare `10` and `5`.
- Compare `"10"` and `10`.
- Compare `false` and `0`.
- Compare `true` and `1`.
- Compare `undefined` and `null`.

```js
// Example
console.log(10 > 5); // Expected output: true
```

---

### 3. Logical Operators

Evaluate the following logical expressions using the logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`). Log the result to the console.

- `(5 > 3) && (8 < 12)`
- `(7 === "7") || (3 === 3)`
- `!(true && false)`
- `(false || true) && !(3 > 5)`

```js
// Example
console.log((5 > 3) && (8 < 12)); // Expected output: true
```

---

### 4. Assignment Operators

Initialize the variable `x` with the value `10`. Perform the following operations using assignment operators and print the results.

- Add `5` to `x` using `+=`.
- Subtract `3` from `x` using `-=`.
- Multiply `x` by `2` using `*=`.
- Divide `x` by `4` using `/=`.
- Find the remainder when `x` is divided by `2` using `%=`.

```js
// Example
let x = 10;
x += 5;
console.log(x); // Expected output: 15
```

---

### 5. Ternary Operator

Write a program to check whether a number is even or odd using the ternary operator. Print `"Even"` if the number is even and `"Odd"` if the number is odd.

```js
let number = 13;
// Example
console.log(number % 2 === 0 ? "Even" : "Odd"); // Expected output: Odd
```

---

### 6. Optional Challenge: Operator Precedence

Consider the following expression and evaluate it step-by-step based on operator precedence. Log the final result.

```js
let result = 10 + 5 * 2 - (3 / 3) + 8;
console.log(result); 
// Expected output: ?
```
